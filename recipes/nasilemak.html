    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Nasi Lemak is a Malaysian word, and it translates to English as "Fat Rice". If I were to actually break down the dish to it's core, it is basically rice with a side serve of chilli.
        The devil is in the details, however, and the rice is cooked with coconut cream/fat and the chilli paste is packed with flavour! Let's dig in.
